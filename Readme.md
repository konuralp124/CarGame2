For the car game, until now, everything is implemented except for the following:
    - Right now, there is only one circuit.
    - Right now, the user can use only one car. There are no options to choose from.
    - Right now, there is no shortcut. 

Other than these, everything is implemented, subject to developments. There is a menu. AI cars work. The race completes in three laps. There is a secondary manu after the reace ends. Winner is determined by checking the times of the user and the AI cars. AI cars follow waypoints on the circuit. The terrain is mountainous with trees and other details.
